A while back, I wrote a short piece about planning scientific projects for New Science. The article explores systematic approaches to identifying impactful research questions and structuring PhD projects for maximum scientific contribution.

Check out the [full article here](https://newscience.org/asking-the-right-questions/) for detailed insights on:

- Strategic frameworks for research question formulation
- Methodologies for evaluating project feasibility and impact
- Best practices for PhD project planning and execution
- Navigation strategies for academic research landscapes

The piece draws from my experience during my PhD and my postdoc, but looking back, I still think it is a solid framework for the "optimal stopping problem" that is deciding whether or not to continue pursuing a project. I hope you find it useful!
