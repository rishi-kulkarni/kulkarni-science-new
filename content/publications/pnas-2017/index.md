  We have designed, synthesized, and applied a rhodol-based chromophore to a molecular 
  wire-based platform for voltage sensing to achieve fast, sensitive, and bright voltage 
  sensing using two-photon (2P) illumination. Rhodol VoltageFluor-5 (RVF5) is a 
  voltage-sensitive dye with improved 2P cross-section for use in thick tissue or brain 
  samples. RVF5 features a dichlororhodol core with pyrrolidyl substitution at the 
  nitrogen center. In mammalian cells under one-photon (1P) illumination, RVF5 
  demonstrates high voltage sensitivity (28% Î”F/F per 100 mV) and improved photostability 
  relative to first-generation voltage sensors. This photostability enables multisite 
  optical recordings from neurons lacking tuberous sclerosis complex 1, Tsc1, in a mouse 
  model of genetic epilepsy. Using RVF5, we show that Tsc1 KO neurons exhibit increased 
  activity relative to wild-type neurons and additionally show that the proportion of 
  active neurons in the network increases with the loss of Tsc1. The high photostability 
  and voltage sensitivity of RVF5 is recapitulated under 2P illumination. Finally, the 
  ability to chemically tune the 2P absorption profile through the use of rhodol scaffolds 
  affords the unique opportunity to image neuronal voltage changes in acutely prepared 
  mouse brain slices using 2P illumination. Stimulation of the mouse hippocampus evoked 
  spiking activity that was readily discerned with bath-applied RVF5, demonstrating the 
  utility of RVF5 and molecular wire-based voltage sensors with 2P-optimized fluorophores 
  for imaging voltage in intact brain tissue.

summary: |
  Fast changes in membrane potential drive neuronal physiology, yet observing neuronal 
  activity noninvasively remains challenging. We report RhodolVoltageFluor-5 (RVF5), 
  an optical voltage reporter with improved photostability and brightness under both 
  one- and two-photon illumination. RVF5 enables robust voltage imaging in thick tissue 
  and brain slices, revealing increased neuronal activity in a mouse model of genetic 
  epilepsy.
