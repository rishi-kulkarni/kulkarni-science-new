abstract: |
  While hierarchical experimental designs are near-ubiquitous in
  neuroscience and biomedical research, researchers often do not
  take the structure of their datasets into account while performing
  statistical hypothesis tests. We present Hierarch, a Python package for
  analyzing nested experimental designs. Using a combination of permutation
  resampling and bootstrap aggregation, Hierarch can be used to
  perform hypothesis tests that maintain nominal Type I error rates
  and generate confidence intervals that maintain the nominal
  coverage probability without making distributional assumptions
  about the dataset of interest.
