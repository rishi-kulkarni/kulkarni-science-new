abstract: |
  Neurons communicate with each other through electrochemical transmission at synapses. 
  Microglia, the resident immune cells of the central nervous system, modulate this 
  communication through a variety of contact-dependent and -independent means. Microglial 
  secretion of active sialidase enzymes upon exposure to inflammatory stimuli is one 
  unexplored mechanism of modulation. Recent work from our lab showed that treatment of 
  neurons with bacterial sialidases disrupts neuronal network connectivity. Here, we find 
  that activated microglia secrete neuraminidase-3 (Neu3) associated with fusogenic 
  extracellular vesicles. Furthermore, we show that Neu3 mediates contact-independent 
  disruption of neuronal network synchronicity through neuronal glycocalyx remodeling. 
  We observe that NEU3 is transcriptionally upregulated upon exposure to inflammatory 
  stimuli and that a genetic knockout of NEU3 abrogates the sialidase activity of 
  inflammatory microglial secretions. Moreover, we demonstrate that Neu3 is associated 
  with a subpopulation of extracellular vesicles, possibly exosomes, that are secreted 
  by microglia upon inflammatory insult. Finally, we demonstrate that Neu3 is necessary 
  and sufficient to both desialylate neurons and decrease neuronal network connectivity. 
  These results implicate Neu3 in remodeling of the glycocalyx leading to aberrant 
  network-level activity of neurons, with implications in neuroinflammatory diseases 
  such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease.

summary: |
  Microglia secrete the membrane-tethered glycolipid sialidase, neuraminidase-3, 
  associated with extracellular vesicles affecting the disconnection of neuronal 
  networks. This novel mechanism provides insight into how neuroinflammation 
  disrupts brain function at the network level through contact-independent 
  glycocalyx remodeling.
