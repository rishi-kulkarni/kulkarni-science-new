### Adding FAQs to Posts
Use the FAQ shortcodes in your content:

```markdown
{{</* faq title="Frequently Asked Questions About [Topic]" */>}}

{{</* faq-item question="First question about your topic?" */>}}
Answer to the first question with detailed information.
{{</* /faq-item */>}}

{{</* faq-item question="Second question about your topic?" */>}}
Answer to the second question with detailed information.
{{</* /faq-item */>}}

{{</* /faq */>}}
```

### Best Practices for SEO
1. Use keyword-rich titles that accurately describe your content
2. Write comprehensive meta descriptions that include your target keywords
3. Use proper heading hierarchy (H1, H2, H3, etc.)
4. Images are beneficial but optional:
   - For statistical content, well-formatted code blocks and equations can be more valuable
   - When using images, include descriptive alt text
   - The default site image will be used when post-specific images aren't provided
5. Link to other related content on your site
6. Update existing content regularly
7. Aim for comprehensive, authoritative content (1500+ words for key topics)
8. Include relevant statistics, examples, and references

## Next Steps for Further Improvement

2. Set up Google Search Console and Bing Webmaster Tools
3. Consider implementing an XML sitemap index for larger sites
4. Create cornerstone content for key statistical topics
5. Develop a backlink strategy to build domain authority
